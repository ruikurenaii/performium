# Performium
A quality-of-life obsidian plugin for gamers.

## What is Performium?
Performium is a plugin that integrates the osu! Performance Points system to Obsidian, gamifying your note-taking experience. Not to be confused by it's name, this plugin does not intend to boost the app's performance.

## What does it add?
This plugin adds a ribbon and command of a new function meant to calculate the performance points. The performance points are based from a few factors:
- Readability
- Complexity
- Information

Once the function has been executed, you'll just have to wait for a while (depending on the size of your vault), and a modal will pop up with the calculated amount.

## Any settings?
There is a setting where you can only get to change the version of the pp system. Remember: Different system versions mean different values!

## Any changes to the PP system?
I had broke down some things for you to understand. The changelog can be found [here](https://ruikurenaii.github.io/performium-pp-changelog).

## Got any suggestions?
