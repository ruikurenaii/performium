    `Some updates may take a while and this is mainly because of the performance points system reworks!`,
    `The developer himself didn't get to sleep because of staying all night developing this plugin without a coffee, which is why you need to buy one located in the plugin's page!`,
    `Once you wrote something short and not concise, the value may get low!`,
    `This is a fun fact that may be useless, but it may change every time you open this?`,
    `The higher the size of your vault, the higher you gain performance points!`,
    `Is it just me, or something feels odd around here?`,
    `Older performance point systems can be put in the settings for future updates!`,
    `Chicken jockey!!`,
    `The developer is an osu! player that goes under the name of hoshinoTaka01?`,
    `The creation date of Performium was also the same day as it was released!`,
    `The beta versions of the plugin are available in the actions tab, but it requires a GitHub account!`,
    `Statistics show that you are ${(Math.random() * 99) + 1}% random!`,
    `I'm sick of spitting out facts everytime you open the plugin settings...`,
    `There was another plugin from the same developer, but it will never be planned for release because it will take him a long time to optimize and organize the code in order to abide by the plugin guidelines!`,
    `Do a flip!`,
  	`Performium took inspiration from the old plugin, Commodity!`,
    `There's nothing else to spit out, so... GET OUT üó£Ô∏èüî•`,
    `Before Performium, the developer relied on ChatGPT about the plugin names, and yet, this name was taken, which was originally thought by the developer himself!`,
    `If you're not sure what different performance point systems mean, newer versions mean newer components, like having new lines the weren't in the older versions in the source code!`,
    `There are a variety of facts you can get! Try to get them all, will you?`,
	`The first version of Performium's pp system wasn't complex enough, while the test version has more of it, but the values may break!`,
    `The developer tried to work as hard as they could, but they're still not getting some money! (Leaving a donation would be fine)`,
    `Performium v1.2.0 added another update to the pp system, with some changes similar to osu!`,
    `I wasn't happy watching the developer suffer making everything including this...`,
    `The developer only coded this from a mobile phone without any test compiling in it!`,
    `There's an official discord server in which you can join by copying this link: https://discord.gg/hXTFFQHC2Q`,
    `The developer tried to add something else, but didn't work at all, so they scrapped the addition!`,
    `The developer got their phone stolen in April Fools 2024 and never got it back! That's not funny at all!`
